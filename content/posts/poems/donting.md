## Poem

```text
望洞庭
LAKE DONCTING VIEWED FROM AFAR
唐 刘禹锡
Tang Dynasty Liu Yuxi

湖光秋月两相和，
The autumn moon dissolve in soft light of the lake,
潭面无风镜未磨。
Unruffled surface like unpolished mirror bright.
遥望洞庭山水翠，
Afar, the isle' mid clear water without a break,
白银盘里一青螺。
Looks like a spiral shell in a plate silver-white.
```
