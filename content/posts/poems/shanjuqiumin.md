## Poem

```text
山居秋暝 AUTUMN EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS
唐·王维 Tang Dynasty Wangwei

空山新雨后，
After fresh rain in mountains bare
天气晚来秋。
Autumn permeates evening air.
明月松间照，
Among pine-trees bright moonbeams peer;
清泉石上流。
O'er crystal stones flows water clear.
竹喧归浣女，
Bamboos whisper of washer-maids;
莲动下渔舟。
Lotus stirs when fishing boat wades.
随意春芳歇，
Though fragrant spring may pass away,
王孙自可留。
Still here's the place for you to stay.
```
